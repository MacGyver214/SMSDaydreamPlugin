# Android Project Final - SMS Message Plugin

This project was the final for my Android development class. We were told to create something on our own or with a partner, and explore something that we didn't explore in class.

At the same time as our class, Google's daydream platform was being launched, and I wanted to try to develop something for it. While inside the VR space, I noticed that it was very annoying to receive a notification about a message on your phone, but have no way to deal or interact with it while you were wearing the headset. The idea of this project was to create a simple messaging app that I could render on a screen and interact with in VR. This repo is the messaging "plugin" that was to be rendered on the screen. I wasn't able to get that to work within the time constraints of the class.

All code was written by me, using a boilerplate Android Studio project.
